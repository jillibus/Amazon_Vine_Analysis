# Amazon Vine Analysis

![logo](images/module_16_logo.png)

# Overview
This project is to analyize the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. This program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to provide a review.

In this project, I picked a product that was reviewed, from approximately 50 different products, from clothing apparel to wireless products.  

For Deliverable 1, I will use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and lod the transformed data into pgAdmin.

For Deliverable 2, I will use Pyspark to read in the exported vine_table, in csv format, into a DataFrame, and determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members.

The results of the above, will allow me to provide SellBy the information they can analyize during their decision process to invest into using or not using the Amazon Vine program.
